# 🌱 Plant Species Classification using Random Forest & Streamlit

## 📖 Overview  
This project focuses on classifying plant species using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of plant images or features. The model is integrated into a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users for input features receive real-time predictions about the species. This repository contains the code, model, and deployment pipeline for the classification system.

## 🚀Features


Machine Learning Model: Utilizes the Random Forest classifier for accurate plant species prediction.

Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.

User Input Options: Allows predictions via manual feature entry.

Data Preprocessing: Includes feature extraction and data normalization.

Deployment Ready: Can be hosted on platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Heroku.

## 🛠️ Installation
